The "Students Performance in Exams" dataset contains information about students' performance in three key subjects: Math, Reading, and Writing. It includes demographic variables such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, lunch type, and whether the student completed a test preparation course. The dataset is widely used in educational data analysis and machine learning to explore how these factors may influence student performance. Researchers and data scientists often use this dataset for tasks such as predicting student scores, identifying patterns in academic performance based on demographic features, and evaluating the effectiveness of test preparation courses. The dataset is available from Kaggle and is provided in a CSV format with clear column names and data types, making it easy to load into popular data analysis tools like Pandas for further exploration and analysis.
